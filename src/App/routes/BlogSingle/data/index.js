        Back in 1998, McDonald’s launched a limited-edition Szechuan 
        dipping sauce to tie in with the release of Disney’s Mulan. 
        Few noticed when the sauce was quietly discontinued soon after, 
        but one man never gave up hope that it might return. That man was 
        Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty, and his love for the 
        sauce was such a running joke in the writers’ room of the hit animated 
        comedy that it made it into the show’s third season as a major plot point. 
        Then things got weird. McDonald’s, never ones to shy away from a publicity 
        stunt, brought Roiland’s favourite condiment back for one day only in 2017. 
        It sold out immediately, and demand was so high in some branches that police 
        had to be called out to deal with fans angrily chanting: “We want sauce.”

        Such is the strange power of Rick and Morty, one of the decade’s more unlikely 
        success stories. Since its debut in 2013, Adult Swim’s seemingly niche cartoon 
        has been obsessed over by everyone from Kanye West to its army of young fans. 
        The most popular comedy among US millennials when its third season launched in 
        2017 (ahead of both The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family), it has the clout not 
        just to lay waste to branches of McDonald’s but to make or break bands; just ask 
        Blonde Redhead, whose song For the Damaged Coda was catapulted into the upper reaches 
        of Billboard’s Hot Rock chart nearly two decades after its release due to an appearance 
        on the show.

      Rick and Morty’s popularity is made even more remarkable
    </h2>
    <p>
        Rick and Morty’s popularity is made even more remarkable by the fact that it exists 
        so purposefully outside the mainstream. Sure, on paper it might sound wholesome: a 
        genius scientist takes his grandson on dimension-hopping adventures. Except that these 
        adventures are all horrifyingly twisted and surreal, the scientist (Rick) is an emotionally
        abusive alcoholic, and the grandson (Morty) regularly experiences levels of trauma that 
        would send most people catatonic. Both tonally and visually, the whole thing is an 
        eye-popping, stomach-churning – and very funny – assault on the senses; one that also 
        somehow finds time to muse on the nature of existence. As Morty says in one memorable 
        episode: “Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody’s going to die. 
        Come watch TV.”

        The credit for the show’s success can be laid squarely at the feet of co-creators Roiland 
        and Dan Harmon, the former of whom also voices the two eponymous stars, although in reality 
        his timbre is closer to long-suffering 13-year-old Morty than his sadistic grandpa. The seeds 
        for the show were planted in 2006 when Roiland presented his crudely drawn sketch The Real 
        Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti – a Back to the Future parody that was the precursor to 
        Rick and Morty – at Harmon’s gonzo short film festival Channel 101. Over the next few years, 
        the two worked on their own projects – Harmon created fan-favourite sitcom Community, while 
        Roiland became known as the voice of Lemongrab in cult kids’ cartoon Adventure Time – but were 
        reunited when Adult Swim asked Harmon to make an animated show. He thought of Roiland straight 
        away, and the two of them set about making Roiland’s gross-out style more palatable to a wider 
        viewership. Acclaim and awards soon followed, notably an Emmy for outstanding animated programme,
        a hotly contested category in this classic era of adult animation.

        Roiland and Harmon, speaking over the phone from LA, suggest that their working relationship 
        is one of balance, creative integrity, and a good dose of taking the piss (“He’s grown very 
        distant and cold,” Harmon jokes of Roiland). Bar the odd squabble over “a tonal thing or a joke”, 
        the pair have “never disagreed to any great extent over anything truly important,” Roiland says.

        It is a relationship that, it’s fair to say, is far healthier than that of Rick and his 
        grandson. Over the course of the show, Rick has wiped Morty’s mind, trapped him in a series 
        of Saw-like murder rooms and caused the separation of his parents. For the most part, poor 
        old Morty has reacted to this litany of horrors with the same terror and disbelief. But in 
        the show’s upcoming fourth season, he is beginning to push back. “Morty’s less afraid to demand 
        things from Rick,” Roiland says. “He’s more disobedient, which I think is a symptom of him seeing 
        all these sides of Rick.” Harmon quickly stresses that that isn’t “a linear thing that will continue 
        until finally Morty kills Rick in his sleep and the show’s over”.
    </p>
    <p>
        For all its brutality, Rick and Morty has made an artform out of dancing along the offensiveness line, 
        keeping the humour sharp and savage without making it cruel, even when Rick himself is behaving cruelly. 
        The jaded scientist may hold extreme views, but they are usually contradicted or mocked within an episode. 
        Rick, Harmon says, represents humanity at its smallest and most cynical. “I think that when you’re feeling 
        great about our world, and [it seems that] there’s meaning to all of it, the thing that you dread the most 
        is typically the thing that Rick can give voice to, which is that it’s wrong, what you’re experiencing is 
        an illusion and it won’t last.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there is the subject of Harmon’s turbulent professional history. A larger-than-life figure, his outspoken 
        temperament has landed him in trouble with colleagues: he has been fired from shows that he’s created – firstly 
        the Sarah Silverman Program (“I started lipping off to Sarah,” Harmon said of his behaviour on the writing team) 
        and Community. Details of the latter firing were revealed when former Community writer Megan Ganz posted on 
        Twitter in 2018, alluding to harassment she received from Harmon and the subsequent impact his actions had on 
        her self-worth. Harmon confessed to abusing his position of power, and to having feelings for her. (“I damaged her 
        internal compass,” he said. “I’ve never done it before and I will never do it again”.) She subsequently accepted 
        his very public apology. The whole process was a rare example of a #MeToo accusation being handled with sensitivity 
        and a desire for resolution, with Ganz claiming it was “a masterclass in How to Apologize”.

        Their ethos bears a remarkable similarity to a rant Rick delivered in the season three premiere, when he 
        said that he was driven not by some moral purpose, but getting hold of that elusive McDonald’s condiment. 
        “Nine more seasons, Morty … I want that McNugget sauce!” Long may his quest continue.
